This is a computer vision project for course T-61.6030, which conducted with my teammate Chen Zhao.

We developed a software to switch the slides by hand movement during presentations. The hand and its movement is captured by a computer camera and then the direction is detected and then the slide will be switched according to the direction. 

This software was developed under the framework of OpenCV and written in C++. 

In this folder, you can find the project report and the source code.
