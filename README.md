SliTran
=======

This is a computer vision project for course T-61.6030, which conducted with my teammate Chen Zhao.

We developed a software to control or switch the slides by hand movement. The hand movement is captured by a computer camera and the slide will be switched to the next or previous according to the direction of the hand movement(right movement or left movement). This software was developed under the framework of OpenCV and written in C++.

Three main algorithms are applied, including:

1. Haar Features

2. Adaboost Algorithm

3. Cascading Multiple Classifier

In this git folder, you can find the project report where you can find more detailed information and the source code (SliTran.cpp).
